Stock Price Forecasting (Time Series ML)

Project Overview
This project explores time series forecasting of stock prices using both statistical models and deep learning models. The aim is to compare the performance of traditional approaches like ARIMA against modern deep learning architectures such as LSTMs and Transformers.

The workflow involves:
Collecting free stock market data using Yahoo Finance
Performing feature engineering on temporal data.
Building multiple forecasting models.
Comparing models using evaluation metrics and backtesting techniques.

Tech Stack & Tools
Languages: Python
Libraries:
Data Handling: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Time Series Models: statsmodels (ARIMA), scikit-learn
Deep Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch (LSTMs, Transformers)
Data Source: yfinance
