Stock Price Forecasting (Time Series ML)

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using a combination of traditional statistical models and modern deep learning approaches. The objective is to collect free stock market data from Yahoo Finance, engineer meaningful time-series features, and then build models such as ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformers to predict future price movements. By comparing the results of statistical methods with deep learning architectures, the project highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach when applied to financial time series.

The implementation is built primarily in Python. Data is collected using the yfinance library, and preprocessing is done with pandas and numpy. For visualization, matplotlib and seaborn are used to create exploratory plots and forecast comparisons. The ARIMA model is implemented with statsmodels, while the deep learning models (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer architectures) are trained using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The project also includes backtesting modules that allow evaluation of predictive performance over historical time windows.

A key part of this work involves feature engineering for temporal data, such as generating lag variables, moving averages, and other rolling indicators that help capture market patterns. These engineered features are combined with raw stock price data to improve the accuracy of the models. Deep learning approaches, particularly LSTMs and Transformers, are designed to handle sequential data more effectively and capture long-term dependencies, while ARIMA offers a baseline through traditional statistical modeling.

The repository is organized into modular components. Data collection and cleaning are handled by dedicated scripts, while separate files manage feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Trained models and experimental results, such as forecast plots and error metrics, are stored in structured folders to ensure reproducibility. The workflow allows users to run experiments with different stocks, adjust model hyperparameters, and compare forecast accuracy across methods.

Through this project, several technical skills are reflected. These include time series forecasting, feature engineering for temporal data, deep learning using LSTMs and Transformers, and model evaluation with backtesting techniques. Together, they represent a comprehensive approach to understanding how advanced machine learning can be applied to financial forecasting.

Future improvements will focus on integrating more advanced financial indicators, expanding to multi-stock forecasting, and developing a user-friendly interface for live predictions through Streamlit or Flask. Ultimately, this project aims to provide both a learning experience in machine learning for time series and a practical demonstration of how these techniques can be applied to real-world financial data.
